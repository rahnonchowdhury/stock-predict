Stock Price Decline Prediction Website
Create a comprehensive web application that predicts weekly stock price declines using news sentiment analysis and market indicators.
Core Requirements
Frontend Features

Clean, professional interface with stock ticker input
Results display showing:

Predicted percentage decline for the coming week
Confidence level (0-100%)
Detailed reasoning with news source citations
Risk disclaimer prominently displayed


Real-time loading indicators during analysis
Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Backend Functionality

Web scraping system to gather news from multiple sources:

Yahoo Finance, Reuters, MarketWatch, CNN Business, Bloomberg
Company press releases and SEC filings
Social media sentiment (Twitter/X, Reddit)


News sentiment analysis using natural language processing
Integration with stock price APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance API)
Caching system to avoid redundant API calls

Prediction Formula
Implement this concrete prediction formula:
Weekly_Decline_% = Base_Decline + (Sentiment_Score × 0.3) + (Volume_Anomaly × 0.2) + (Technical_Indicator × 0.15) + (Market_Correlation × 0.1)

Where:
- Base_Decline = Historical 5-week average decline percentage
- Sentiment_Score = Weighted average of news sentiment (-10 to +10 scale)
- Volume_Anomaly = (Current_Volume - 20_Day_Avg_Volume) / 20_Day_Avg_Volume
- Technical_Indicator = RSI deviation from 50 + Bollinger Band position
- Market_Correlation = S&P 500 beta coefficient × market trend
Technical Architecture

Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: SQLite for caching news and predictions
APIs:

News APIs (NewsAPI, Finnhub, or similar)
Stock data APIs (Alpha Vantage free tier)
Sentiment analysis (use a library like sentiment or vader-sentiment)



Key Components to Build
1. News Scraper Module
javascript// Fetch news from multiple sources
// Filter for relevant financial news
// Extract and clean article content
// Score sentiment using NLP libraries
2. Stock Data Module
javascript// Fetch current stock price and historical data
// Calculate technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands)
// Determine volume anomalies
// Get market correlation data
3. Prediction Engine
javascript// Apply the prediction formula
// Weight different news sources appropriately
// Calculate confidence levels based on data quality
// Generate detailed reasoning explanations
4. Citation System

Track all news sources used in prediction
Include publication dates and relevance scores
Link back to original articles
Maintain source credibility ratings

Data Sources Integration

News Sources: Yahoo Finance RSS, Reuters API, MarketWatch scraping
Stock Data: Alpha Vantage API (free tier allows 5 calls per minute)
Market Data: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for market indicators
Social Sentiment: Twitter API v2 (if budget allows) or Reddit API

Specific Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure

Set up React frontend with stock input form
Create Express.js backend with API endpoints
Implement basic stock data fetching
Add error handling and loading states

Phase 2: News Integration

Build web scraping modules for each news source
Implement sentiment analysis pipeline
Create news relevance scoring system
Add data caching with expiration

Phase 3: Prediction Engine

Code the mathematical prediction formula
Integrate all data sources into prediction pipeline
Build confidence scoring system
Create detailed explanation generator

Phase 4: Polish and Deployment

Add comprehensive error handling
Implement rate limiting for API calls
Add legal disclaimers and terms of service
Style the interface professionally
Add data visualization (charts showing prediction reasoning)

Required Dependencies
json{
  "express": "^4.18.0",

Important Features to Include

Legal Disclaimers: "This is not financial advice. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."
Rate Limiting: Prevent API abuse
Data Validation: Ensure stock tickers are valid
Error Handling: Graceful failures when APIs are down
Caching: Store recent predictions to reduce API calls

Sample News Analysis Logic
javascriptfunction analyzeNewsImpact(articles) {
  const keywords = {
    negative: ['strike', 'lawsuit', 'decline', 'loss', 'bankruptcy', 'fraud'],
    positive: ['growth', 'profit', 'expansion', 'acquisition', 'breakthrough']
  };
  
  // Weight by source credibility and recency
  // Calculate composite sentiment score
  // Identify specific events (earnings, product launches, etc.)
}
Output Format
For each prediction, display:

Stock symbol and company name
Predicted decline percentage (e.g., "7.3% decline expected")
Confidence level (e.g., "Medium confidence - 68%")
Top 3 reasons with news citations
Technical analysis summary
Last updated timestamp

Testing Strategy

Mock API responses for development
Test with various stock symbols (large cap, small cap, volatile stocks)
Validate prediction formula with historical data
Ensure all news sources are properly cited

Remember to include prominent disclaimers about the speculative nature of stock predictions and that this tool should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions.
